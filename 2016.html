    The 2016 Presidential Campagin Hack
    The 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign was hacked due to email phishing.
the hackers targeted email accounts of political campaign staff, and other
individuals involved in the election. 

The Presidential Campaign attack was a email phishing, malware and hacking attack.

The hackers use the email accounts and sent emails that contained
links and maliscious software. 
The recipients of the emails fell for the trap since they believed that they
were being sent information from there trusted sources.
 
The vulnerability in the 2016 Presidential Campaign was due to various
reasons, a combination of different attacks.
As stated above it was due to email phishing, malware and hacking events, multiple
tactics potentially by multiple people.
One example would be email phishing, using a trusted source account
to send out information such as attachments that would get access to the 
recipients computer, software, account, etc.


There are many ways to prevent or defend this attack from 
occuring again or minimizing the effects, or damage.
Since there were a variety of cyber attacks, including email phishing, 
hacking, and disinformation campaigns, there would
or many different types of ways to defending against 
these types of attacks. Down below 
there are several strategies that can be implemented 
to help reduce the risk of a successful attack:

Employee training: One of the best ways 
to defend against cyber attacks is to educate 
employees on best practices for online security, 
such as how to identify phishing emails and suspicious 
links, how to create strong passwords, and how to 
report suspicious activity. Also implementing a 
regular training module, or session to keep the information
fresh and update the employees on up to date information
on any new hacking methods.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Implementing 
MFA can help prevent unauthorized access to email 
accounts, cloud-based services, and other critical 
systems by requiring users to provide two or more 
forms of identification, such as a password and a fingerprint.
Another method can be 2 way verification or 2 way device verification
to be provided to be able to access any accounts with sensitive information

Create and design Secure email gateways: Secure email gateways can help 
filter out spam, phishing emails, and malicious attachments 
before they reach end-users, reducing the risk of a successful attack.
It would also help to install anti email phisphing cyber attacks
which can help filter malicious emails.

Continuous vulnerability assessments: Conducting regular 
vulnerability assessments can help identify and address 
vulnerabilities in the organization's networks, systems, 
and applications before they can be exploited by attackers.
This would help keep all systems up to date with any new
patches or bugs that may need to be fixed.

These are but a few ways that could have helped defend the 2016
Presidential Election Campaign. And potential new way to defend of 
one now in the future attacks, or events.

Some security measures that could have been used to prevent this attack
would have been to use strong passwords for emails, or to regularly change 
ones password maybe after alot of emails were sent, or just a day to day
security meeasure to be followed.
Also having a back up or a incident response plan for what steps are taken when 
and attack like this has happened.
There should have been a plan to help organizations defend and end an oncoming
attack or prevent ir from getting any worse.
